## Exercises

### Basic Requirements

#### Numbers

1. Enter the following expressions into your console.

   ```js
   1 + 2
   3 * 5
   5 / 4 - 13
   5000 * 234
   1073 / 57 + 200
   ```

2. Why are the values produced by the following two expressions different? What
   are they?

   ```js
   3 + 2 * 4 - 1
   (3 + 2) * (4 - 1)
   ```

3. Calculate 50 years in minutes using the console.

4. What is the percentage of letters in the english alphabet that are vowels (including y)? Use the
   console to find out.

5. Try the following expressions in the console:

   ```js
   6 % 2
   42 % 10
   5 % 2
   6 % 3
   7 % 4
   100 % 12
   ```

   What is the significance of the result? How does the `%` (modulus) operator
   work?

6. Try the following:

   ```js
   3 % 2
   4 % 2
   5 % 2
   6 % 2
   ```

   What do the results tell you about the first operand to the modulus operator?

#### Strings

1. Write a string that represents your full name.

2. Write a string that represents your favorite food.

3. Use the `+` operator to combine (known as *concatenation*) two or more
   strings, *e.g.*:

   ```js
   // Your first and last names
   "John" + " " + "Doe"
   ```

   + Your first and last names (as shown above)
   + Your best friend's full name
   + Your home town, state and country


4. Fix the errors in the following strings:

   ```js
   Where are all the quotes?
   'hmm something is not right"
   'Do other ' * 'operators work with string concatenation?
   ```
